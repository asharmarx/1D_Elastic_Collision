# 1D Elastic Collision and Number of Collisions

A solution to a great brain bender problem presented in this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).

The number of collisions between a mass
``` m1 = 1kg``` and mass ``` m2 = m1 * 10^n``` will result in exactly ```pi * 10^(n-1)``` collisions, due to the fact that the two governing equations (conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy) represent a system of equations of a circle and a line with variable y-intercept. The intersections of these two functions represents the solution as shown in the figure.
